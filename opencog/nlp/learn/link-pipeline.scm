; This code is part of a language-learning effort.  The goal is to
; observe a lot of text, and then perform clustering to min-max the
; entropy. Right now, only the observe part is supported.
;
; Main entry point: (observe-text plain-text)
; Call this entry point with exactly one sentance as plain text.
; It will be parsed by RelEx, and the resulting link-grammar link
; usage counts will be updated in the atomspace. The counts are
; flushed to the SQL database so that they're not forgotten.
;
; As of 10 December 2013, this seems to work fine. Deploying ...

; increment the attached CountTruthValue; save back to SQL.  Note:
; we are not directly accessing the database; we're just letting the
; atomspace handle that semi-automatically.
