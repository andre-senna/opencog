            Helper classes to deal with HUGE Atomese (.scm) files
            -----------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a couple of classes and programs to help dealing with
HUGE Atomese (.scm) files. The issue with such files is that compiling them
either in guile or using "guild compile" requires a LOT of RAM.

SCMLoader 
---------

A helper class that implements a simple strategy to load huge .scm files by parsing
each toplevel atom separately and feeding it (with all the inner atoms, in the case 
of links) in an AtomSpace.

PGStorageDelegate
-----------------

A helper class that uses SCMLoader to load a .scm file into an AtomSpace and store
this AtomSpace in a Postgress DB.

Helper executables
------------------

There are also two executable programs.

    scm2pgsql - Expects a .scm file name and the DB credentials and properly read the 
                file and store the resulting AtomSpace into the DB
    loadscm   - Just crteates an empty AtomSpace and populate it with the contents of
                the passed file before dying. This is useful to test with new .scm files
                and probe the amount of time/RAM riquered to load that file.
